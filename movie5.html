        In the story of France under King Louis XIV, the country is bankrupt due
        to his unpopular wars. The king's hedonistic luxury and seduction of
        women are portrayed through the Three Musketeers, who have retired from
        their roles. The king's son Raoul returns from the war and is enlisted
        in the musketeers, but is killed by Dutch cannons. Athos, the king's
        Captain of the Musketeers, seeks revenge and kills two musketeers before
        being overpowered. Louis invites Christine to the palace, where she
        sleeps with him. Aramis, the secret leader of the Jesuit order, plots to
        overthrow the king with the help of his old comrades. The three
        Musketeers sneak into an island prison and escape a mysterious prisoner,
        Philippe, who is the identical twin of King Louis. Aramis reveals that
        Philippe was sent away by his father to save France from dynastic
        warfare. Louis later discovered Philippe's existence and devised a way
        to keep him hidden using the iron mask. King Louis seduces Christine,
        who confesses to her love for Raoul. Angered, Louis forsakes Christine
        and abducts her. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis teach Philippe to act like
        royalty, abducting Louis during a fancy dancing ball. Philippe saves
        Christine's life when she accuses him of murdering Raoul. D'Artagnan
        orders the palace musketeers to be on full alert and escorts Philippe to
        the underground dock. D'Artagnan learns that Philippe is Louis' brother
        and pleads with Louis to spare his life. Louis refuses, but Philippe
        pleads for execution. Louis orders Philippe placed in the Bastille and
        hangs herself. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, the Three Musketeers, break
        into the Bastille prison with Philippe. Louis prepares an ambush, but
        the guards' respect prevents them from overwhelming the four Musketeers.
        Philippe offers to give himself up in exchange for their lives, but
        D'Artagnan refuses, revealing that he is the twins' father and served
        Louis out of fatherly devotion. The four Musketeers and Philippe charge
        Louis' front line, stuning the soldiers into immobility. Louis stabs
        Philippe, but D'Artagnan reminds him that Louis is his brother.
        Philippe's mask is removed, allowing D'Artagnan to see his face one last
        time.
