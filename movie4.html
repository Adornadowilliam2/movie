        The film begins with a clip from the old Western TV series "Bounty Law"
        featuring action star Rick Dalton as Jake Cahill. Rick is a fan of
        Rick's work and is a has-been due to his ongoing alcoholism. Rick and
        his stuntman, Cliff Booth, meet producer Marvin Schwarz, who suggests
        Rick shoot Spaghetti Westerns in Rome. Rick is resentful of this and
        decides to work with director Roman Polanski to reinvigorate his career.
        Cliff rehearses his lines for "Lancer" and meets Sharon Tate, a rising
        starlet. They have a party at the Playboy Mansion, where Charles Manson
        visits and apologizes for an error. Cliff brings Rick to the set of
        "Lancer" for the shoot, where he meets Bruce Lee, who challenges Cliff
        to a fight. Lee gets Cliff down first, but Lee retaliates by slamming
        him into a car. Janet, Randy's wife and fellow stunt coordinator, is
        pissed to see Cliff and Lee fighting, leading to his firing. Sharon
        drives through Hollywood, visiting bookstores and movie theaters to see
        her film "The Wrecking Crew." She is invited to the box office and
        receives a ticket. Rick, a method actor, works on "Lancer" with his
        co-star Trudi. They discuss their readings and Rick struggles with his
        perceived decline in stardom. Cliff, a blind actor, visits the Spahn
        Ranch with Rick, where they encounter hippies and a woman who denies
        taking advantage of him. Cliff confronts a male hippie who stabs him in
        the face, but is praised by both the director and Trudi. Rick improvises
        his villain character and throws Trudi off, receiving praise from both
        the director and Trudi. Six months later, Rick and Cliff fly to Rome to
        shoot Spaghetti Western films. Rick meets the director, Manson, and they
        discuss their careers. The film ends with Rick and Cliff reunited six
        months later, six months after their initial meeting.
