        The movie "To Tell the Truth" begins with an episode of the popular game
        show 'To Tell the Truth' set in 1977. Three contestants appear claiming
        to be the legendary Frank William Abagnale, who impersonated an airline
        pilot, a lawyer, and a doctor, and scammed people on three continents
        for millions of dollars before reaching the age of nineteen. Frank
        reveals the name of Carl Hanratty, an FBI agent. The film then shifts to
        1969, with FBI agent Carl Hanratty arriving at a French prison to
        extradite a flu-stricken Frank Abagnale Jr. Frank attempts to escape but
        is too sick to even make it outside. The film then flashes back to six
        years earlier, where 16-year-old Frank Abagnale Jr. lives in New
        Rochelle, New York with his father Frank Abagnale, Sr. (Christopher
        Walken), and French mother Paula (Nathalie Baye). Frank's father takes
        him to a store where Frank watches as his father cons a woman into
        lending him a black suit for Frank Jr. Frank drives his father to the
        Chase Manhattan Bank dressed with the suit and pretending to be his
        chauffeur, in a ruse to impress the bank people and secure a loan. When
        the loan is denied, the family is forced to move from their grand home
        to a small apartment, causing tension between Frank's parents. Frank
        tries to con his way into transportation and shelter, using his
        checkbook to con his way into transportation and shelter. He eventually
        runs away from home, using his checkbook to con his way into
        transportation and shelter. Carl Hanratty, a persistent FBI agent,
        tracks down Frank's check fraud and arrests him. Frank pretends to be
        Agent "Barry Allen" of the United States Secret Service, but
        fingerprints collected in the room lead nowhere. Frank attempts to use
        the money he has stolen to find a way to reunite his divorced parents,
        but Carl realizes that Frank has no one else to talk to. Carl's men
        search for runaways in the New York area, eventually leading them to
        Frank's mother, who has now remarried to Paula.
