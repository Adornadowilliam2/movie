        Keldysh and his team search the wreckage of the RMS Titanic for a
        necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They discover a
        safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing the necklace, dated
        April 14, 1912. Rose Dawson Calvert, claiming to be the person in the
        drawing, visits Lovett and shares her experiences aboard the ship. Rose,
        angry and distraught about her mother's arranged marriage, considers
        suicide but Jack saves her. Cal offers Jack a small amount of money, and
        they develop a tentative friendship. Rose secretly joins Jack at a party
        in third class, and Cal's butler sneaks down to spy on her. Rose later
        realizes she prefers Jack over Cal and takes Jack to her state room to
        display Cal's engagement present. Cal orders the butler to find Rose,
        and they have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold.

        In the Titanic, an iceberg hits the ship, causing significant damage to
        watertight compartments and causing the ship to sink. The ship's
        builder, Thomas Andrews, warns that due to a design flaw, water will
        spill over the bulkheads at E Deck, causing the ship to sink. Cal
        discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and a mocking note from her, leading to
        his arrest and handcuffing. Rose is desperate to free Jack, and Cal
        rescues him. They board a lifeboat, but Cal is denied access to the
        lifeboat due to a previous arrangement. Cal then chases Rose and Jack
        into the flooding dining saloon, where they are trapped. Cal decides to
        escape, but is denied access by the First Officer. As the stern rises
        out of the water, Jack and Rose climb over the rail to take positions on
        the stern. The ship breaks in half, causing the stern to crash into the
        water and killing Lovejoy, the butler. Jack and Rose ride the stern into
        the ocean, where it plunges to the bottom. As they let go of the stern,
        the Titanic disappears into the darkness below them. Rose and Jack find
        a piece of paneling from the Grand Staircase and Jack assures her that
        she will die an old woman.
