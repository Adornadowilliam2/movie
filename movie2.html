        Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stockbroker, is a successful businessman
        who becomes the "Wolf of Wall Street" after his firm, Stratton Oakmont,
        is discovered by FBI Agent Patrick Denham. Belfort's company, which he
        calls Stratton Oakmont, is a pump and dump scam, with a reputation for
        high commissions. He befriends salesman Donnie Azoff and they start a
        lavish lifestyle, using prostitutes and drugs. The FBI intensifies the
        investigation, and Jordan makes $22 million on the IPO of Steve Madden
        Ltd. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with the
        corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's aunt Emma.
        They use friends with European passports to smuggle cash to Switzerland.
        When Donnie gets into a public fight with Brad Bodnick, their scheme is
        nearly exposed. Donnie offers Jordan a powerful brand of Quaaludes to
        help him cope with the bad news. However, when Donnie is arrested,
        Jordan fights him to save Donnie's life. With the shadow of law
        enforcement over them, Jordan decides to stay on Stratton Oakmont.
        Jordan, Donnie, and their wives sail to Monaco to settle their bank
        account, but a violent storm capsizes their yacht. After being arrested,
        Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for
        leniency. After one last bout of sex, Naomi tells Jordan she will
        divorce him and wants full custody of their children. Jordan wears a
        wire to work and slips a note warning him about it, leading to Agent
        Denham arresting him for breaching his cooperation deal. Despite this,
        Jordan receives a reduced sentence and is sentenced to 36 months in a
        minimum security prison in Nevada.
